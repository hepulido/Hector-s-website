            <h2>HELLO WORLD!</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Hector and I'm a passionate software developer.
            With a background in computer science and a Fullstack Academy
            training, I've developed a strong foundation in programming and an
            aptitude for learning new technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            On this website, you'll find a showcase of my portfolio projects
            that demonstrate my skills in front-end and back-end development.
            Whether it's building a responsive web application with HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript or designing and deploying a server with Node.js and
            a database like MongoDB, I'm always eager to take on new challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to my portfolio, you can also find links to my social
            media and GitHub profiles. I believe in the power of community and
            collaboration in software development, and I'm always looking to
            connect with other developers and contribute to open-source
            projects.
          </p>
          <p>Thank you for visiting my website and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
